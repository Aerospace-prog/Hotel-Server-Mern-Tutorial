 What are models OR scheme in Mongoose?

    Models are basically the blueprint of the data that we are gonna store in the database.
    We can preform CRUD operation on the models/schema.
    For Blueprint we maintain a folder called models
    Schema is a data structure(types , required, unique values ) of the models.



Body-parser --> is a middleware library of Express.js
    It is used to parse and extract the body of incoming HTTP requests.,SO it grabs JSON data and converts in object and stores in req.body


Async and await --> are features in JavaScript that make it easier to work with asynchronous code, such as network requests, file system operations, or database queries.
    Using try and catch block
    The try block contains the code for creating a new Person document and saving it to the database using await newPerson.save().
    If an error occurs during any step, it is caught in the catch block, and an error response is sent with a 500 Internal Server Error status.


Parameterized API Calls --> Now if someone told us to give a list of people who are only waiters EG:- /person/waiters

Parameterized URL --> localhost:3000/person/:work
--> work : ["chef","waiter","manager"]


Express Route -->
We have a lots of Endpoints in a single file server.js
This makes bad experience in code readability as well as code handling Express Router is a way to modularize and organize your route handling code in an Express.js application.
So let's create a separate file to manage endpoints /person and /menu Express Router is like a traffic cop for your web server
Express Router helps you organize and manage these pages or endpoints
in your web application. It's like creating separate folders for different types of tasks.
Create a folder ROUTES to store all your routes



Update operation-->

For Updation we need two things o Which record we want to update?
What exactly we want to update?
For update we will use PUT method to create a endpoint

Delete operation -->


We will Delete our person Record, for that we will create an endpoint from where we are able to delete record
For Deletion we need one things
Which record we want to update ?
For delete we will use DELETE method to create a endpoint
What is a unique identifier in a document in a collection?
It's_id which is given by mongodb itself, we will use this to find the particular record which we want to delete

Hosting ==>
To Host out mongoDb databse on cloud we will use MongoDB Atlas

Dotenv Module ==>
We will use dotenv to store our sensitive data like password, username etc in a file named .env
